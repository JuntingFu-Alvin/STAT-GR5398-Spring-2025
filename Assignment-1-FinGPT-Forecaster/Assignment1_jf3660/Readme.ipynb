    "# FinGPT-Forecaster Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains code and notebooks for the STAT-GR5398-Spring-2025 Assignment 1: Practical Application of FinGPT-Forecaster. The project involves using and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B to predict stock price movements using the Dow 30 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The FinGPT-Forecaster is a state-of-the-art financial LLM designed to synthesize market insights and predict stock price movements. This project provides hands-on experience in running LLMs, comparing different model architectures, and analyzing their outputs in the context of financial forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files\n",
    "- `FinGPT_Forecaster.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the complete pipeline for setup, data preprocessing, fine-tuning, testing, and metrics calculation.\n",
    "- `Llama_3.1_8B.ipynb`: Notebook focused on loading, fine-tuning, and testing the Llama-3.1-8B model.\n",
    "- `LoRA_Fine_Tuning_on_Both_Models.ipynb`: Notebook for LoRA fine-tuning of both Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek models.\n",
    "- `deepseek.ipynb`: Notebook focused on loading, fine-tuning, and testing the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model.\n",
    "- `utils.ipynb`: Utility functions for data preprocessing, testing, and metrics calculation.\n",
    "- `config.json`: Configuration file for model and training settings.\n",
    "- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.\n",
    "- `train.sh`: Shell script for training the models (optional, for advanced users).\n",
