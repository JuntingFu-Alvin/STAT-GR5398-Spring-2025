        "# FinGPT-Forecaster Project\n",
        "\n",
        "This repository contains code and notebooks for the STAT-GR5398-Spring-2025 Assignment 1: Practical Application of FinGPT-Forecaster. The project involves using and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama-3.1-8B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B to predict stock price movements using the Dow 30 dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "The FinGPT-Forecaster is a state-of-the-art financial LLM designed to synthesize market insights and predict stock price movements. This project provides hands-on experience in running LLMs, comparing different model architectures, and analyzing their outputs in the context of financial forecasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Files\n",
